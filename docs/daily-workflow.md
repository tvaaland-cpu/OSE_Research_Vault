# Daily workflow

This is the recommended evidence loop:

**import -> note -> snippet -> metric -> memo -> export**

## 1) Import

- Open the Documents workflow and import new source files for the company you are reviewing.
- Confirm extraction completed and text is searchable.
- Quickly reject duplicates/noise before proceeding.

Practical tip: do imports in one batch first so the rest of the session is analysis, not file management.

## 2) Note

- Create a short note for the session (`daily`, `update`, or your preferred type).
- Write the question you are trying to answer first (for example: "Did guidance quality improve?").
- Add bullet placeholders for evidence you expect to collect.

This note is your working scratchpad and later feeds memo drafting.

## 3) Snippet

- Highlight key quotes/facts from imported documents into snippets.
- Keep each snippet atomic (one claim per snippet).
- Include locator/context so you can defend the claim later.
- Link snippet to the correct company/document and optionally the working note.

Quality bar: someone else should be able to reopen the source and verify in under a minute.

## 4) Metric

- For each numeric snippet, create or update a metric.
- Fill period, value, unit, and currency consistently.
- Resolve conflicts deliberately when duplicate metrics are detected.

Suggested pattern:

- Use a stable metric name (`Revenue`, `Gross Margin`, `FCF`).
- Use canonical period formats (`FY2025`, `Q4 2025`, `TTM`).

## 5) Memo

- Generate or draft the memo after evidence is assembled.
- Ensure each major claim traces to snippets/metrics.
- Keep an explicit section for open questions and disconfirming evidence.

At this stage, polish logic and prioritization—not raw extraction.

## 6) Export

- Publish memo for distribution when ready.
- Export a company research pack with the desired redaction/profile options.
- Save the exported artifact to your team handoff folder.

End-of-day closeout checklist:

- [ ] New documents imported
- [ ] Session note updated
- [ ] Snippets linked and clean
- [ ] Metrics reconciled
- [ ] Memo refreshed
- [ ] Export generated (if sharing day)
