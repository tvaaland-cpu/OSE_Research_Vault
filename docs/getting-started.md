# Getting started

This guide is for analysts who want a practical setup flow in **OSE Research Vault**.

## 1) First launch checklist

1. Build and run the app.
2. Create or select your first workspace.
3. Add at least one company so notes, snippets, and metrics can be linked.
4. Open the **Documents** area and import a starter file (PDF, transcript, or notes export).

If this is your first launch, the app creates settings, local SQLite data, and workspace folders automatically under your user profile unless you configured custom paths.

## 2) Core areas to know

- **Companies**: Your research universe and metadata.
- **Documents**: Imported source files and extracted text.
- **Snippets**: Evidence excerpts tied to documents and companies.
- **Notes**: Working thoughts, updates, and memo drafts.
- **Metrics**: Structured values (period, unit/currency, value).
- **Export / Publish memo**: Share-ready output for a company or memo.

## 3) Suggested folder hygiene

Even though the app is local-first, disciplined inputs help later search/export quality:

- Keep source filenames consistent (`YYYY-MM-DD Source Topic.pdf`).
- Import one canonical copy per source document.
- Use note titles with date + topic (`2026-02-Weekly-Review`).
- Tag private/sensitive notes clearly if your export profile supports redaction.

## 4) Your first 30 minutes

1. Import 3-5 documents for one company.
2. Capture 5-10 snippets with clear locator/context.
3. Create 1-2 notes summarizing what changed.
4. Convert 3-4 numeric claims into metrics.
5. Generate a short memo and export a research pack.

Once this baseline exists, the daily workflow becomes mostly incremental updates.
